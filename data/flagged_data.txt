"Congratulations on the promotion Mitchell! We wouldn't have survived through the pandemic without you and your team. As a token of our appreciation, we've given you a £2100 salary bump. This will take effect as of next month's payroll. At May-Wood we value the care and work you put in. See you on Monday Rachel, enjoy!"
"Happy Birthday Ms Brenda Parsons! You're 74 today. Our latest offers will be sure to get you into the party spirit!"
"Hannah, the pension policy has changed slightly since the meeting last week. I know you've just finished putting through all the changes, but I need you to look at Ms Cox's file. We'll need to  modify it by adding another 0.15% on top of the existing £23594. Drop me a message when you've done this please, it's quite urgent."
